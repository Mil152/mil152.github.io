- ESM3 pushes the boundaries of protein design by integrating sequence, structure, and function into a single unified framework.  
- It scales up to 98 billion parameters and leverages multimodal inputs, enabling generative design and evolutionary insights.  
- Simulates evolutionary processes, producing proteins equivalent to 500 million years of natural evolution within days.  

### Multimodal Protein Modeling  

- Utilizes three key modalities:  
  - **Sequence**: Captures patterns in amino acid arrangements.  
  - **Structure**: Predicts 3D protein configurations.  
  - **Function**: Designs biologically relevant proteins based on evolutionary goals.  
- Embeds modalities into a shared latent space, allowing flexible and efficient protein generation.  

### Revolutionary Protein Design  

- Demonstrates its generative power with **esmGFP**, a novel fluorescent protein sharing only 58% sequence identity with its closest relative.  
- Empowers programmable protein creation by combining structural motifs and novel scaffolds.  
- Aligns generative outputs with user-specified functional goals using fine-tuning mechanisms.  

### Scalability and Performance  

- Trained on **3.15 billion sequences** and **236 million structures**, with a total of **771 billion tokens**.  
- Largest version contains 216 transformer layers, outperforming smaller models on generative and predictive tasks.  
- Scaling laws of AI emphasize that larger models achieve superior generalization and innovation.
