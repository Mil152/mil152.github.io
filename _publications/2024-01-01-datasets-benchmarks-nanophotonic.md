### Abstract

Nanophotonic structures have versatile applications including solar cells, antireflective coatings, electromagnetic interference shielding, optical filters, and light
emitting diodes. To design and understand these nanophotonic structures, electrodynamic simulations are essential. These simulations enable us to model electromagnetic fields over time and calculate optical properties. In this work, we
introduce frameworks and benchmarks to evaluate nanophotonic structures in the
context of parametric structure design problems. The benchmarks are instrumental
in assessing the performance of optimization algorithms and identifying an optimal
structure based on target optical properties. Moreover, we explore the impact of
varying grid sizes in electrodynamic simulations, shedding light on how evaluation
fidelity can be strategically leveraged in enhancing structure designs.
