### Abstract

In this paper, we demonstrate a highly conductive, stretchable, and wash-durable fabric for a variety of electronic textile applications such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, Joule heating, and strain sensing by utilizing a chemical etchant pretreatment that promotes covalent bonding, a reactive silver ink with conformal in situ silver reduction, and the use of a polymer coating for a protective barrier. Reactive ink coated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) knitted textiles exhibit an average EMI shielding efficiency of **74.8 dB** in the X band (frequency range of **8–12 GHz**) and **76.6 dB** in the Ku band (**12–18 GHz**). The conductive textiles show high Joule heating performance, where a temperature of **152°C** can be achieved at only **1.3 V DC** applied voltage. This Joule heating performance is maintained after stretching and washing.Furthermore, the textile may be used for strain sensing and monitoring human movement. As prepared silver films do not degrade after **1000 stretching cycles** at **50% strain** and maintain EMI SE higher than **70 dB** after **300 min** washing. The demonstrated textiles may be used for wearable electronics, personal medical devices, and next-generation communications.
