### Abstract

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have great potential for use in large-area display and lighting applications, but their widespread adoption for large areas is hindered by the high cost and insufficient performance of indium tin oxide (ITO) anodes. In this study, we introduce an alternative anode material – a silver mesh embedded in glass – to facilitate production of large-area OLEDs. We present a facile, scalable manufacturing technique to create high aspect ratio micromeshes embedded in glass to provide the planar geometry needed for OLED layers. Our phosphorescent green OLEDs achieve a current efficiency of **51.4 cd/A at 1000 cd/m^2** and reach a slightly higher external quantum efficiency compared to a standard ITO/glass reference sample. Notably, these advancements are achieved without any impact on the viewing angle of the OLEDs. These findings represent a promising advancement towards ITO-free, high-efficiency OLEDs for various high performance, large-area applications, such as lighting and displays.
