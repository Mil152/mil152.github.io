The Andorian race has all but been annihilated. While searching for survivors, an array of ancient tombs has been discovered.Each tomb is a nearly hemispherical shell structure rumored to conceal vital Andorian secrets. Temperature activated locks safeguard artifacts stored within the walls of the tombs. Your team has been recruited to engineer a device to release the locking mechanism, with the hope of finding information needed to locate and save the remaining members of the Andorian race from certain doom. Your colleagues are developing controllers to maintain an axisymmetric temperature on the inner surface of a tomb. They are depending on you to determine an applied temperature profile that will open the lock. Beware, the entire structure will implode, killing anyone inside, if the walls are heated and the internal temperatures are not correct.
