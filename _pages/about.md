Hey there! I’m Mingxuan Li, currently diving into the depths of AI as a PhD candidate over at the University of Pittsburgh. My passion? It's all about blending AI with science and sparking a bit of digital transformation magic in this AI revolution. I’ve been knee-deep in AI-powered optics design, alongside dabbling in computational electromagnetics and Bayesian Optimization. It's like being a wizard, but with algorithms.

Leading the charge at the MDS-Rely center, I’m at the helm of a project ambitiously titled “Machine Learning for EMI Shielding Design." Oh, and in my spare time, I moonlight as a reviewer for IEEE journals. Talk about wearing multiple hats, right?

Before embarking on this PhD journey, I was a chemist, mixing and brewing small molecules for pharmaceutical companies. That chapter of my life instilled in me a lasting fascination with cheminformatics—once a chemist, always a chemist, as they say.

Recently, I’ve dipped my toes into the open-source software pool. I kicked off a TMM solver project called [LayerLumos](https://github.com/Mil152/LayerLumos), which, not to brag, runs circles around the usual commercial solvers, being 10 times faster than what you might get from Ansys. It's surprisingly fun!

So, here I am, mixing science with a dash of humor, and always on the lookout for the next interesting project. Stick around; it’s never a dull moment!
